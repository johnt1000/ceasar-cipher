# Ceasar Cipher
Project that implements the Caesar cipher, using JavaScript.

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. It's a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the original text is 'shifted' a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The shift is the key to the cipher. The name "Caesar Cipher" comes from the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar, who reportedly used this cipher with a shift of 3 to communicate with his generals.

Here's an example of how the Caesar Cipher works:

Original text: HELLO Shift: 3 Encrypted text: KHOOR

As you can see, each letter in the original text was shifted 3 positions down the alphabet.

The Caesar Cipher is a symmetric cipher, which means that to decrypt the message you would do the reverse process, i.e., shift the letters 3 positions up the alphabet.
